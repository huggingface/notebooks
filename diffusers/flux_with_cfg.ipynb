    "Flux with CFG\n",
    "\n",
    "Flux, as a model, does not inherently use Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the implementation here incorporates CFG inspired by the PuLID Flux adaptation, which allows for more effective control over the generated output using prompts. The script was contributed by [Linoy Tsaban](https://github.com/linoytsaban),[apolinário](https://github.com/apolinario) and [Sayak Paul](https://github.com/sayakpaul). The notebook is contributed by [Parag Ekbote](https://github.com/ParagEkbote)."
