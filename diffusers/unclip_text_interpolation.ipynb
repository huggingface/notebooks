    "\n",
    "The input prompts are converted to text embeddings by the pipeline's text_encoder and the interpolation is done on the resulting text_embeddings over the number of steps specified. Defaults to 5 steps. This script was contributed by [Naga Sai Abhinay](https://github.com/Abhinay1997/) and the notebook by [Parag Ekbote](https://github.com/ParagEkbote)."
