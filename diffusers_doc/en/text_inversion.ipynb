    "[Textual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01618) is a technique for capturing novel concepts from a small number of example images. While the technique was originally demonstrated with a [latent diffusion model](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion), it has since been applied to other model variants like [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/conceptual/stable_diffusion). The learned concepts can be used to better control the images generated from text-to-image pipelines. It learns new \"words\" in the text encoder's embedding space, which are used within text prompts for personalized image generation.\n",

    "This guide will show you how to train a [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) model with Textual Inversion. All the training scripts for Textual Inversion used in this guide can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/textual_inversion) if you're interested in taking a closer look at how things work under the hood.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a community-created collection of trained Textual Inversion models in the [Stable Diffusion Textual Inversion Concepts Library](https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library) which are readily available for inference. Over time, this'll hopefully grow into a useful resource as more concepts are added!\n",

    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you install the library's training dependencies:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "pip install diffusers accelerate transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "accelerate config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup a default 🤗 Accelerate environment without choosing any configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "accelerate config default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if your environment doesn't support an interactive shell like a notebook, you can use:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "from accelerate.utils import write_basic_config\n",
    "\n",
    "write_basic_config()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you try and [install xFormers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/training/optimization/xformers) to reduce your memory footprint with xFormers memory-efficient attention. Once you have xFormers installed, add the `--enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention` argument to the training script. xFormers is not supported for Flax."

    "Usually, text prompts are tokenized into an embedding before being passed to a model, which is often a transformer. Textual Inversion does something similar, but it learns a new token embedding, `v*`, from a special token `S*` in the diagram above. The model output is used to condition the diffusion model, which helps the diffusion model understand the prompt and new concepts from just a few example images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, Textual Inversion uses a generator model and noisy versions of the training images. The generator tries to predict less noisy versions of the images, and the token embedding `v*` is optimized based on how well the generator does. If the token embedding successfully captures the new concept, it gives more useful information to the diffusion model and helps create clearer images with less noise. This optimization process typically occurs after several thousand steps of exposure to a variety of prompt and image variants."
