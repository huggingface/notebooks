This makes it a useful tool for image restoration like removing defects and artifacts, or even replacing an image area with something entirely new.

This only works if the chained pipelines are using the same VAE. For example, in the [Text-to-image-to-inpaint](#text-to-image-to-inpaint) section, Kandinsky 2.2 uses a different VAE class than the Stable Diffusion model so it won't work. But if you use Stable Diffusion v1.5 for both pipelines, then you can keep everything in latent space because they both use [AutoencoderKL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/models/autoencoderkl#diffusers.AutoencoderKL).\n",
