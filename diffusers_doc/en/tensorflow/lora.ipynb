    "[Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) is a training method that accelerates the training of large models while consuming less memory. It adds pairs of rank-decomposition weight matrices (called **update matrices**) to existing weights, and **only** trains those newly added weights. This has a couple of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Previous pretrained weights are kept frozen so the model is not as prone to [catastrophic forgetting](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611835114).\n",
    "- Rank-decomposition matrices have significantly fewer parameters than the original model, which means that trained LoRA weights are easily portable.\n",
    "- LoRA matrices are generally added to the attention layers of the original model. 🧨 Diffusers provides the [load_attn_procs()](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/loaders#diffusers.loaders.UNet2DConditionLoadersMixin.load_attn_procs) method to load the LoRA weights into a model's attention layers. You can control the extent to which the model is adapted toward new training images via a `scale` parameter. \n",
    "- The greater memory-efficiency allows you to run fine-tuning on consumer GPUs like the Tesla T4, RTX 3080 or even the RTX 2080 Ti! GPUs like the T4 are free and readily accessible in Kaggle or Google Colab notebooks.\n",
