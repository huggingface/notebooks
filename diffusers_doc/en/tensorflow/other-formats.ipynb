    "huggingface-cli login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Git clone the repository containing the `.ckpt` file you want to convert. For this example, let's convert this [TemporalNet](https://huggingface.co/CiaraRowles/TemporalNet) `.ckpt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git lfs install\n",
    "git clone https://huggingface.co/CiaraRowles/TemporalNet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open a pull request on the repository where you're converting the checkpoint from:\n",

    "\n",
    "    - `checkpoint_path`: the path to the `.ckpt` file to convert.\n",
    "    - `original_config_file`: a YAML file defining the configuration of the original architecture. If you can't find this file, try searching for the YAML file in the GitHub repository where you found the `.ckpt` file.\n",
    "    - `dump_path`: the path to the converted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        For example, you can take the `cldm_v15.yaml` file from the [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet/tree/main/models) repository because the TemporalNet model is a Stable Diffusion v1.5 and ControlNet model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now you can run the script to convert the `.ckpt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python ../diffusers/scripts/convert_original_stable_diffusion_to_diffusers.py --checkpoint_path temporalnetv3.ckpt --original_config_file cldm_v15.yaml --dump_path ./ --controlnet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once the conversion is done, upload your converted model and test out the resulting [pull request](https://huggingface.co/CiaraRowles/TemporalNet/discussions/13)!\n",
