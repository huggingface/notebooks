    "🧨 Diffusers is designed to be a user-friendly and flexible toolbox for building diffusion systems tailored to your use-case. At the core of the toolbox are models and schedulers. While the [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/text_to_video#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) bundles these components together for convenience, you can also unbundle the pipeline and use the models and schedulers separately to create new diffusion systems. \n",

    "\n",
    "That was super easy, but how did the pipeline do that? Let's breakdown the pipeline and take a look at what's happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the pipeline contains a UNet model and a DDPM scheduler. The pipeline denoises an image by taking random noise the size of the desired output and passing it through the model several times. At each timestep, the model predicts the *noise residual* and the scheduler uses it to predict a less noisy image. The pipeline repeats this process until it reaches the end of the specified number of inference steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recreate the pipeline with the model and scheduler separately, let's write our own denoising process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the model and scheduler:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    >>> from diffusers import DDPMScheduler, UNet2DModel\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> scheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_pretrained(\"google/ddpm-cat-256\")\n",
    "    >>> model = UNet2DModel.from_pretrained(\"google/ddpm-cat-256\").to(\"cuda\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the number of timesteps to run the denoising process for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    >>> scheduler.set_timesteps(50)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Setting the scheduler timesteps creates a tensor with evenly spaced elements in it, 50 in this example. Each element corresponds to a timestep at which the model denoises an image. When you create the denoising loop later, you'll iterate over this tensor to denoise an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    >>> scheduler.timesteps\n",
    "    tensor([980, 960, 940, 920, 900, 880, 860, 840, 820, 800, 780, 760, 740, 720,\n",
    "        700, 680, 660, 640, 620, 600, 580, 560, 540, 520, 500, 480, 460, 440,\n",
    "        420, 400, 380, 360, 340, 320, 300, 280, 260, 240, 220, 200, 180, 160,\n",
    "        140, 120, 100,  80,  60,  40,  20,   0])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create some random noise with the same shape as the desired output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    >>> import torch\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> sample_size = model.config.sample_size\n",
    "    >>> noise = torch.randn((1, 3, sample_size, sample_size)).to(\"cuda\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now write a loop to iterate over the timesteps. At each timestep, the model does a [UNet2DModel.forward()](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/models#diffusers.UNet2DModel.forward) pass and returns the noisy residual. The scheduler's [step()](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/schedulers/ddpm#diffusers.DDPMScheduler.step) method takes the noisy residual, timestep, and input and it predicts the image at the previous timestep. This output becomes the next input to the model in the denoising loop, and it'll repeat until it reaches the end of the `timesteps` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    >>> input = noise\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> for t in scheduler.timesteps:\n",
    "    ...     with torch.no_grad():\n",
    "    ...         noisy_residual = model(input, t).sample\n",
    "    >>> previous_noisy_sample = scheduler.step(noisy_residual, t, input).prev_sample\n",
    "    >>> input = previous_noisy_sample\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the entire denoising process, and you can use this same pattern to write any diffusion system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The last step is to convert the denoised output into an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    >>> from PIL import Image\n",
    "    >>> import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> image = (input / 2 + 0.5).clamp(0, 1)\n",
    "    >>> image = image.cpu().permute(0, 2, 3, 1).numpy()[0]\n",
    "    >>> image = Image.fromarray((image * 255)).round().astype(\"uint8\")\n",
    "    >>> image\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, you'll put your skills to the test and breakdown the more complex Stable Diffusion pipeline. The steps are more or less the same. You'll initialize the necessary components, and set the number of timesteps to create a `timestep` array. The `timestep` array is used in the denoising loop, and for each element in this array, the model predicts a less noisy image. The denoising loop iterates over the `timestep`'s, and at each timestep, it outputs a noisy residual and the scheduler uses it to predict a less noisy image at the previous timestep. This process is repeated until you reach the end of the `timestep` array.\n",

    "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image *latent diffusion* model. It is called a latent diffusion model because it works with a lower-dimensional representation of the image instead of the actual pixel space, which makes it more memory efficient.
