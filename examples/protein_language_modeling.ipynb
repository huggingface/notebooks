    "With proteins, however, things are very easy. In protein language models, each amino acid is converted to a single token. Every model on `transformers` comes with an associated `tokenizer` that handles tokenization for it, and protein language models are no different. Let's get our tokenizer!"

Note also that UniProt annotates residues starting from 1 (unlike Python, which starts from 0), and region annotations are inclusive (so 1..3 means residues 1, 2 and 3).
