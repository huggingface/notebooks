Note that we didn't do a lot of work to filter the training data or tune hyperparameters for this experiment, and also that we used one of the smallest ESM-2 models. With a larger starting model and more effort to ensure that the training data categories were cleanly separable, accuracy could almost certainly go a lot higher!"
