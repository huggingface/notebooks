    "Next, we convert our datasets to `tf.data.Dataset`, which Keras understands natively. There are two ways to do this - we can use the slightly more low-level [`Dataset.to_tf_dataset()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset) method, or we can use [`Model.prepare_tf_dataset()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset). The main difference between these two is that the `Model` method can inspect the model to determine which column names it can use as input, which means you don't need to specify them yourself. It also supplies a data collator by default which is appropriate for most tasks."
