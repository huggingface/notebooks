The built-in loss will also correctly handle things like masking the loss on padding tokens, or unlabelled tokens in the case of masked language modelling, so we recommend using it unless you're an advanced user!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, because the outputs and loss for this model class are quite straightforward, we can use built-in Keras metrics - these are liable to misbehave in other contexts (for example, they don't know about the masking in masked language modelling) but work well here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use `jit_compile` to compile the model with [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla). In other cases, we should be careful about that - if our inputs might have variable sequence lengths, we may end up having to do a new XLA compilation for each possible length, because XLA compilation expects a static input shape! In this notebook, however, we have padded all examples to exactly the same length. This makes it perfect for XLA, which will give us a nice performance boost."
