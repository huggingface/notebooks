    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Few months ago we introduced the [Time Series Transformer](https://huggingface.co/blog/time-series-transformers), which is the vanilla Transformer ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)), and showed an example for the **univariate** probabilistic forecasting task (i.e. predicting each time series' 1-d distribution individually). In this post we introduce the _Informer_ model ([Zhou, Haoyi, et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436)), AAAI21 best paper which is now available in 🤗 Transformers. We will show how to use Informer for the **multivariate** probabilistic forecasting task, i.e., predicting the distribution of a future **vector** of time-series target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the modeling aspect of probablistic forecasting is concerned the Transfomer/Informer will require no change when dealing with multivariate time series. In both the univariate and multivariate setting the model will recieve a sequence of vectors and thus the only change is on the output or emission side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling the full joint conditional distribution of a high dimensional data can get computationally expensive and thus methods resort to some approximation of the distribution, the easiest being to model the data as independent distribution from the same family, or some low-rank approximation to the full covariance, etc. Here we will just resort to the independent (or diagonal) emissions which is supported for the families of distributions we have implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Informer - Under The Hood\n",
    "\n",
    "Todo: Informer picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the vanilla Transformer ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)), Informer employs two major improvements. To understand these improvments, let's recall the vanilla Transformer  drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quadratic computation of canonical self-attention: The vanilla Transformer has computational complexity of $O(T^2 D)$ where $T$ is the time series length and $D$ is the dimension of the hidden states. For long sequence time-series forecasting (also known as the _LSTF problem_), this might be really computationally expensive. To solve this problem, Informer employs a new self-attention mechanism called ProbSparse, which has $O(T \\log T)$ time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory bottleneck when stacking layers: When stacking $N$ encoder/decoder layers, the vanilla Transformer has  memory usage of $O(N T^2)$, which limits the model's capacity for long sequences. Informer uses a distilling operation, for reducing the input size between layers into its half slice. By doing so, it reduces the whole memory usage to be $O(T  \\log T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the motivation for the Informer is similar to Longformer (xxx), Sparse Transformer and other NLP papers (xxx) for reducing the quadratic complexity of the self-attention **when the input sequence is long**. Now, let's dive into ProbSparse attention and the Distilling operation with code examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ProbSparse Attention (Complete)\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical self-attention scores form a long-tail distribution, where the \"active\" queries lie in the \"head\" scores and \"lazy\" queries lie in the \"tail\" area. We designed the ProbSparse Attention to select the \"active\" queries rather than the \"lazy\" queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "ProbSparse is based on the idea that the attention weights are composed from few dot-product pairs that contribute to the major attention. Our goal is to find those pairs, and create a reduced Query matrix which will be used for calculating the attention weights\n",
    "In more details, recall the canonical self attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO canonical self attention formula \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find the dot-product pairs which contribute to QK multiplication. How? .\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find a Query matrix Q_reduce such that Q_reduce * K will contain only the paris that contribute to the major attention. But how to find this Q_reduce? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. few dot-product contribute - motivation\n",
    "2. the queries in dot-product who do not contribute, forms a uniform distribution. We want to select queries which don't\n",
    "form a uniform distribution\n",
    "3. Define sparsity mesurse for select the best quries \n",
    "\n",
    "Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create the U_part from K \n",
    "2. find u for top-u queries \n",
    "3. compute Q_K_sample \n",
    "4. slice top_u from it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query Sparsity Measurement\n",
    "The dominant <q,k> pairs encourage the corresponding query’s attention probability distribution away from the uniform distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distilling (Complete)\n",
    "conv layers between encoder layers\n",

    "\n",
    "The _Informer_ model in now available in the 🤗 Transformers library, which simply called `InformerModel`. In the sections below, we will show how to train this model on a custom multivariate time-series dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install the necessary libraries: 🤗 Transformers, 🤗 Datasets, 🤗 Evaluate,  🤗 Accelerate and [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will show, GluonTS will be used for transforming the data to create features as well as for creating appropriate training, validation and test batches."

    "As time series researchers will know, there has been a lot of interest in applying Transformer based models to the time series problem. The vanilla Transformer is just one of many attention-based models and so there is a need to add more models to the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment there is nothing stopping us from modeling multivariate time series, however for that one would need to instantiate the model with a multivariate distribution head. Currently, diagonal independent distributions are supported, and other multivariate distributions will be added. Stay tuned for a future blog post which will include a tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing on the roadmap is time series classification. This entails adding a time series model with a classification head to the library, for the anomaly detection task for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current model assumes the presence of a date-time together with the time series values, which might not be the case for every time series in the wild. See for instance neuroscience datasets like the one from [WOODS](https://woods-benchmarks.github.io/). Thus, one would need to generalize the current model to make some inputs optional in the whole pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the NLP/Vision domain has benefitted tremendously from [large pre-trained models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), while this is not the case as far as we are aware for the time series domain. Transformer based models seem like the obvious choice in pursuing this avenue of research and we cannot wait to see what researchers and practitioners come up with!\n"
