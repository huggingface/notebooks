    "`PatchTSMixer` is a lightweight time-series modeling approach based on the MLP-Mixer architecture. It is proposed in [TSMixer: Lightweight MLP-Mixer Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.09364) by IBM Research authors Vijay Ekambaram, Arindam Jati, Nam Nguyen, Phanwadee Sinthong and Jayant Kalagnanam.\n",
    "\n",
    "For effective mindshare and to promote open-sourcing - IBM Research joins hands with the HuggingFace team to release this model in the Transformers library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Hugging Face implementation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/patchtsmixer), we provide PatchTSMixerâ€™s capabilities to effortlessly facilitate lightweight mixing across patches, channels, and hidden features for effective multivariate time-series modeling. It also supports various attention mechanisms starting from simple gated attention to more complex self-attention blocks that can be customized accordingly. The model can be pretrained and subsequently used for various downstream tasks such as forecasting, classification, and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PatchTSMixer` outperforms state-of-the-art MLP and Transformer models in forecasting by a considerable margin of 8-60%. It also outperforms the latest strong benchmarks of Patch-Transformer models (by 1-2%) with a significant reduction in memory and runtime (2-3X). For more details, refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, we will demonstrate examples of getting started with PatchTSMixer. We will first demonstrate the forecasting capability of `PatchTSMixer` on the Electricity dataset. We will then demonstrate the transfer learning capability of PatchTSMixer by using the model trained on Electricity to do zero-shot forecasting on the `ETTH2` dataset.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By Transfer Learning, we mean that we first pretrain the model for a forecasting task on a `source` dataset (which we did above on the `Electricity` dataset). Then, we will use the\n",
    " pretrained model for zero-shot forecasting on a `target` dataset. By zero-shot, we mean that we test the performance in the `target` domain without any additional training. We hope that the model gained enough knowledge from pretraining which can be transferred to a different dataset. \n",
    " \n",
    " Subsequently, we will do linear probing and (then) finetuning of the pretrained model on the `train` split of the target data, and will validate the forecasting performance on the `test` split of the target data. In this example, the source dataset is the Electricity dataset and the target dataset is `ETTH2`.\n",
