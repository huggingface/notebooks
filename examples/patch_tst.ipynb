    "# Patch Time Series Transformer in HuggingFace - Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, we provide examples of how to get started with PatchTST. We first demonstrate the forecasting capability of `PatchTST` on the Electricity data. We will then demonstrate the transfer learning capability of `PatchTST` by using the previously trained model to do zero-shot forecasting on the electrical transformer (ETTh1) dataset. The zero-shot forecasting performance will denote the `test` performance of the model in the `target` domain, without any  training on the target domain. Subsequently, we will do linear probing and (then) finetuning of the pretrained model on the `train` part of the target data and will validate the forecasting performance on the `test` part of the target data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PatchTST` model was proposed in A Time Series is Worth [64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/papers/2211.14730) by Yuqi Nie, Nam H. Nguyen, Phanwadee Sinthong, Jayant Kalagnanam and presented at ICLR 2023.\n",

    "## Quick overview of PatchTST\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the model vectorizes individual time series in a batch into patches of a given size and encodes the resulting sequence of vectors via a Transformer that then outputs the prediction length forecast via an appropriate head.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is based on two key components: \n",
    "  1. segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which serve as input tokens to the Transformer; \n",
    "  2.  channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series, i.e. a [global](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.03.004) univariate model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: \n",
    " - local semantic information is retained in the embedding; \n",
    " - computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window via strides between patches; and \n",
    " - the model can attend longer history via a trade-off between the patch length (input vector size) and the context length (number of sequences).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, `PatchTST` has a modular design to seamlessly support masked time series pre-training as well as direct time series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",

    "|(a) `PatchTST` model overview where a batch of \\\\(M\\\\) time series each of length \\\\(L\\\\) are processed independently (by reshaping them into the batch dimension) via a Transformer backbone and then reshaping the resulting batch back into \\\\(M \\\\) series of prediction length \\\\(T\\\\). Each *univariate* series can be processed in a supervised fashion (b) where the patched set of vectors is used to output the full prediction length or in a self-supervised fashion (c) where masked patches are predicted. |"

We hope that the model gained enough knowledge from pretraining which can be transferred to a different dataset. \n",
