       "      <td>This week in Washington, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will sit down with President Barack Obama and tell him the US-Japan military alliance is stronger than ever.\\nIn many ways this peculiar love affair between the US and Japan, which began after one country dropped atom bombs on the other, does look pretty solid.\\nBut while Japanese people may like the protection that the US alliance brings, they don't much like the US bases and tens of thousands of personnel that come with it.\\nMost will never get to see the 50,000 US military personnel stationed in their country. That's because most of the Americans are far away on the island of Okinawa.\\nOkinawa makes up just 0.6% of Japan's land mass but, as the locals will never tire of telling you, it hosts over 70% of the US bases in Japan.\\nThe people of Okinawa are weary of the 70 years of \"semi-occupation\". They have long complained of the noise and danger from US planes and helicopters flying day and night.\\nMost of all they complain of the young men of the US Marine Corps, who are seen as drunken, violent and a threat to Okinawan women.\\nIn fact the statistics speak otherwise - the incidence of rape, murder and other crimes by American personnel in Okinawa is low.\\nBut a small number of horrific cases have done huge harm - in particular the 1995 gang rape of a 13-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl by four US Marines changed attitudes here dramatically.\\nIt's a big reason why the US government wants to move Futenma, the largest Marine base in Okinawa, out of the densely populated south of the island to a remote spot 60km away.\\nIt sounds like a good idea. The city of Ginowan will get a big chunk of land back. Its people will get to sleep at night and its daughters will no longer have to fear.\\nBut for most Okinawans, 60km is not nearly far enough. They want to see the US Marines moved much further - say Guam for instance, or even better, Australia.\\nAs plans for building the new base at Camp Schwab have moved forward, attitudes here have hardened. Tokyo insists there is no other choice.\\nOkinawans have responded by kicking out the pro-Tokyo governor and electing a new one who has promised to block any construction. Tokyo has simply over-ruled him.\\nIt is, say many in Okinawa, the behaviour of a colonial regime, and it is making people here mad.\\nAt 6:30 on a chilly morning I find myself outside the gates of Camp Schwab with around 100 elderly, but determined, protesters.\\nAt first it is noisy but pretty docile. But then as the construction crews start to arrive the elderly protesters roll in to action.\\nEn masse they rush out in to the road and lie down in front of one of the vehicles. The police struggle to pull them away, four policemen for each protester. They kick and scream.\\n\"Why are you betraying your own people?\", they shout. \"Why are you helping the Americans?\"\\nThrough it all, blaring away on his megaphone, is protest leader Satoru Oshiro.\\n\"It is 70 years since the end of the war, but still we have to bear the overwhelming burden of US bases here in Okinawa.\"\\n\"In a democratic country that is not right,\" he says. \"Now they want to build a new base here, we cannot allow that to happen.\"\\nThe emotions here are complex. Okinawans feel semi-occupied by the US military, but their feelings towards Tokyo are also deeply ambivalent.\\nThere is deep bitterness here, in particular about how their overlords from the \"mainland\" sacrificed them at the end of World War 2.\\n\"Okinawa is the only place in Japan that experienced battle on the ground,\" says Satoru Oshiro \"We cannot forget the tragedy, the horrible past.\"\\nAnd it was unspeakably horrible.\\nOn a hilltop just outside the capital Naha, I find Takamatsu Gushiken digging for human remains.\\nHe and a small team of volunteers have been doing this for over 30 years. All they have is some old trowels, a few buckets and one yellow metal detector. Each year they uncover the remains of around 100 people - most are civilians, many are women and children.\\n\"When I find the bones of child and woman together, I cannot help but think that must be a mother and child and think about which died first,\" Gushiken says.\\n\"I heard of lots of babies sucking their mother's breast after she has died. Was it like that or did the child go first and the mother hung on to the baby? It makes it very hard for us to see sights like that.\"\\nAll the more so when you realise that many of the victims he unearths did not die in battle but killed themselves on the orders of Japanese military commanders.\\n\"The Japanese military was the only military that ordered soldiers and people to take their own lives, rather than surrender.\\n\"People were taught that killing themselves was a noble act. When I see those remains, it is very hard for me to forgive teaching in Japan at that time.\"\\nThe carnage wrought by this policy is terrible to think about.\\nPerhaps a quarter of a million people died here in three months of slaughter from April to June 1945. No-one has ever apologised to the people of Okinawa for what they were put through, not the US, certainly not Tokyo.\\nBack at Camp Schwab the protesters have now taken to the water.\\nMuch of the new marine base will be built by landfilling a pristine reef with millions of tonnes of rock and soil and building two long runways in Henoko Bay.\\nThe protesters are now in small sea kayaks. They can slip in to the shallowest water and dodge between rocks.\\nFor an hour there is a game of cat and mouse as the tiny kayaks try to slip into the construction zone. But the coastguards, in their powerful speedboats, outflank them and round them up like a dog herding wayward sheep.\\nIt is an unequal contest - but the sentiment of people here in Okinawa is clear. They don't want the new base.\\nWhen Prime Minister Abe tells President Obama everything here is under control, he should not be reassured.</td>\n",

He has held the seat since 2005, when he ended a 95-year rule by the Conservative Party. Though on Friday he saw his majority slide by 3,315 to 8,949, from 60% to 51.5%.\\nAt the Lib Dem conference in March, Mr Farron - seen by some as a frontrunner to succeed Nick Clegg - was quoted in the Mail on Sunday suggesting the party's brand would be tainted for a generation by governing with the Conservatives.\\nAsked if he would stand to replace Mr Clegg if he was no longer leader, Mr Farron said it would be \"foolish and disloyal\" to consider a post-election leadership bid.\\nMr Farron was elected as the party's president in November 2010, winning 53% of the vote and taking over the role in January 2011. He was re-elected unopposed in autumn 2012, until handing over the role at the beginning of January 2015 to Baroness Brinton.\\nA long-standing Norwich City supporter, Norman Lamb served first as chief parliamentary adviser to Nick Clegg following the 2010 general election and then as a junior minister at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, before he was promoted to minister of state for care and support at the Department of Health.\\nIn January 2015, he was appointed to the Lib Dem general election cabinet as the party's health spokesperson.\\nOn Friday, he told BBC Radio Norfolk: \"I will think carefully about how I can best serve my party\".\\nMr Lamb has served as Norfolk North's MP since 2001. The son of Hubert Lamb, a leading climatologist, he studied law at Leicester University and, after working as a parliamentary assistant for a Labour MP, built a career as a litigation solicitor, ultimately specialising in employment law.\\nHe was partner of Steeles Solicitors and is the author of 'Remedies in the Employment Tribunal'.\\nGreg Mulholland held his Leeds North West seat, where he has been MP since 2005.\\nShortly before Mr Clegg's resignation as party leader on Friday, Mr Mulholland ruled himself out of the leadership contest. When asked, he told ITV News: \"No. Very easy answer...My priority is rebuilding [the party] locally.\"\\nFollowing Mr Clegg's resignation later on Friday, Mr Mulholland said on Twitter: \"The 2010 failure to ensure no Liberal Democrat MP voted against a rise in [student tuition] fees was catastrophic. Now we need a leader who voted against.\"\\nMr Mulholland was one of the Lib Dems who voted against a fee rise (see the full list of how the Lib Dems voted here).\\nHe continued on Twitter: \"In 2010 the party made the right decision to go into Coalition. Then the leadership made 3 fatal errors 1. fees 2. NHS Act 3. bedroom tax.\\n\"It really is time for a realignment of British politics &amp; a voting system that does not grotesquely distort &amp; disenfranchise.\"\\nMP for Southport since 2005, John Pugh held on to his seat, despite losing 8,055 votes.\\nWinning with a reduced majority, he said on Friday that it was time for the party to reflect on how it moves forward after devastating losses across the country.\\nMr Pugh has previously served as shadow spokesman for transport and health, and, after the election of Nick Clegg as party leader, he worked with Vince Cable as shadow Treasury spokesman.\\nWith the formation of the coalition in 2010 he was appointed as co-chairman of the Liberal Democrat parliamentary committee for health and social care, a position he relinquished at the end of 2013 to focus on producing a report examining the social and economic issues facing the north.\\nBorn in Liverpool, he graduated in philosophy from Durham University before entering the teaching profession - where he taught in the state and independent sectors and was head of philosophy and religious studies at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby, prior to his election.\\nMark Williams is the only Liberal Democrats MP in Wales, after successfully holding on to his seat in the Ceredigion constituency.\\nMr Williams was appointed to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee in 2005 before becoming the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Wales, and at varying times has been spokesman on schools and higher education.\\nBorn in Hertford and educated at Aberystwyth University, Mr Williams worked for the Liberal MP for Ceredigion, Geraint Howells, before becoming a research assistant to Liberal Peers in the House of Lords. He later worked as a primary school teacher and deputy head teacher before being elected to parliament in 2005.\\nAlistair Carmichael was the only Lib Dem MP to survive the SNP landslide in Scotland - 10 others lost their seats.\\nThough his  Orkney and Shetland seat was considered to be one of the party's safest, his majority was cut from 9,928 to 817, with a 23.9% swing to the SNP.\\nThe safety of his seat has previously led to speculation that the former Scottish secretary could be a potential successor to Mr Clegg.\\nHowever, in February he appeared to rule out any bid for the leadership. When asked whether he would like to lead the party, Mr Carmichael said: \"No. There's no vacancy and I have the constituency that is furthest away from London.\\n\"I have got a family that still includes school age children. And the commitment that it takes to be party leader in modern politics is enormous.\\nAt the party conference in March, he said liberalism was needed \"more than ever\".\\nHe told the conference: \"In a world where nationalism and populism can seem like attractive options - a world where the power of the state and corporate interests can seem to overwhelm the rights and freedoms of the individual - in a world like that liberalism is needed more than ever before and more than ever before our country needs Liberal Democrat influence in government.\\nLiberal Democrat Tom Brake was the only party member to hold his seat in London, in Carshalton and Wallington, beating Tory rival Matthew Maxwell Scott by 1,500 votes.\\nIn every other London seat, the capital is now in the hands of either Labour or the Conservatives.\\nMr Brake has held his seat since 1997, when he overturned a Tory majority. In September 2012, he was appointed to his first ministerial position as deputy leader of the House of Commons, having been appointed a privy counsellor in June 2011.\\nFollowing Mr Clegg's resignation, Mr Brake told BBC London: \"I don't think he should be the fall guy\". He confirmed on Sunday Politics he would not be contesting the leadership.</td>\n",
