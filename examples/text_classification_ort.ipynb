The most important is the [`ORTTrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/trainer#optimum.onnxruntime.ORTTrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. You can also use `TrainingArguments` in Transformers, but `ORTTrainingArguments` enables more optimized features of ONNX Runtime. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:"

The `tokenizer` has a pad method that will do all of this right for us, and the `ORTTrainer` will use it.
