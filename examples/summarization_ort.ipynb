    "\n",

    "In this notebook, we will walk through the fine-tuning of [T5-small](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5) model in the ðŸ¤— Transformers for a summarization task. We will use the [XSum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745.pdf) dataset (for extreme summarization) which contains BBC articles accompanied with single-sentence summaries, and the training as well as inference will be done by leveraging `ORTSeq2SeqTrainer` in Optimum! \n",
