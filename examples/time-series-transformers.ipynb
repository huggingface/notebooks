    "# Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with 🤗 Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting is an essential scientific and business problem and as such has also seen a lot of innovation recently with the use of [deep learning based](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3533382) models in addition to the [classical methods](https://otexts.com/fpp3/). An important difference between classical methods like ARIMA and novel deep learning methods is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Probabilistic Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, classical methods are fitted on each time series in a dataset individually. These are often referred to as  \"single\" or \"local\" methods. However, when dealing with a large amount of time series for some applications, it is beneficial to train a \"global\" model on all available time series, which enables the model to learn latent representations from many different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some classical methods are point-valued (meaning, they just output a single value per time step) and models are trained by minimizing an L2 or L1 type of loss with respect to the ground truth data. However, since forecasts are often used in some real-world decision making pipeline, even with humans in the loop, it is much more beneficial to provide the uncertainties of predictions. This is also called \"probabilistic forecasting\", as opposed to \"point forecasting\". This entails modeling a probabilistic distribution, from which one can sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in short, rather than training local point forecasting models, we hope to train **global probabilistic** models. Deep learning is a great fit for this, as neural networks can learn representations from several related time series as well as model the uncertainty of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common in the probabilistic setting to learn the future parameters of some chosen parametric distribution, like Gaussian or Student-T; or learn the conditional quantile function; or use the framework of Conformal Prediction adapted to the time series setting. The choice of method does not affect the modeling aspect and thus can be typically thought of as yet another hyperparameter. One can always turn a probabilistic model into a point-forecasting model, by taking empirical means or medians.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Time Series Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of modeling time series data which are sequential in nature, as one can imagine, researchers have come up with models which use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) like LSTM or GRU, or Convolutional Networks (CNN), and more recently Transformer based methods which fit naturally to the time series forecasting setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we're going to leverage the vanilla Transformer [(Vaswani et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) for the **univariate** probabilistic forecasting task (i.e. predicting each time series' 1-d distribution individually). The Encoder-Decoder Transformer is a natural choice for forecasting as it encapsulates several inductive biases nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, the use of an Encoder-Decoder architecture is helpful at inference time where typically for some logged data we wish to forecast some prediction steps into the future. This can be thought of as analogous to the text generation task where given some context, we sample the next token and pass it back into the decoder (also called \"autoregressive generation\"). Similarly here we can also, given some distribution type, sample from it to provide forecasts up until our desired prediction horizon. This is known as Greedy Sampling/Search and there is a great blog post about it [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) for the NLP setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, a Transformer helps us to train on time series data which might contain thousands of time points. It might not be feasible to input *all* the history of a time series at once to the model, due to the time- and memory constraints of the attention mechanism. Thus, one can consider some appropriate context window and sample this window and the subsequent prediction length sized window from the training data when constructing batches for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The context sized window can be passed to the encoder and the prediction window to a *causal-masked* decoder. This means that the decoder can only look at previous time steps when learning the next value. This is equivalent to how one would train a vanilla Transformer for machine translation, referred to as \"teacher forcing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of Transformers over the other architectures is that we can incorporate missing values (which are common in the time series setting) as an additional mask to the encoder or decoder and still train without resorting to in-filling or imputation. This is equivalent to the `attention_mask` of models like BERT and GPT-2 in the Transformers library, to not include padding tokens in the computation of the attention matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of the Transformer architecture is the limit to the sizes of the context and prediction windows because of the quadratic compute and memory requirements of the vanilla Transformer, see [Tay et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732). Additionally, since the Transformer is a powerful architecture, it might overfit or learn spurious correlations much more easily compared to other [methods](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=D7YBmfX_VQy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The 🤗 Transformers library comes with a vanilla probabilistic time series Transformer model, simply called the [Time Series Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/time_series_transformer). In the sections below, we'll show how to train such a model on a custom dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install the necessary libraries: 🤗 Transformers, 🤗 Datasets, 🤗 Evaluate,  🤗 Accelerate and [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will show, GluonTS will be used for transforming the data to create features as well as for creating appropriate training, validation and test batches."

    "\n",
    "Of course, we need to be careful with just claiming state-of-the-art results on time series with neural networks, as it seems [\"XGBoost is typically all you need\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001679).  We are just very curious to see how far neural networks can bring us, and whether Transformers are going to be useful in this domain. This particular dataset seems to indicate that it's definitely worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We would encourage the readers to try out the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/time-series-transformers.ipynb) with other time series datasets from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/monash_tsf) and replace the appropriate frequency and prediction length parameters. For your datasets, one would need to convert them to the convention used by GluonTS, which is explained nicely in their documentation [here](https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/forecasting/extended_tutorial.html#What-is-in-a-dataset?). We have also prepared an example notebook showing you how to convert your dataset into the 🤗 datasets format [here](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/time_series_datasets.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "As time series researchers will know, there has been a lot of interest in applying Transformer based models to the time series problem. The vanilla Transformer is just one of many attention-based models and so there is a need to add more models to the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment there is nothing stopping us from modeling multivariate time series, however for that one would need to instantiate the model with a multivariate distribution head. Currently, diagonal independent distributions are supported, and other multivariate distributions will be added. Stay tuned for a future blog post which will include a tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing on the roadmap is time series classification. This entails adding a time series model with a classification head to the library, for the anomaly detection task for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current model assumes the presence of a date-time together with the time series values, which might not be the case for every time series in the wild. See for instance neuroscience datasets like the one from [WOODS](https://woods-benchmarks.github.io/). Thus, one would need to generalize the current model to make some inputs optional in the whole pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the NLP/Vision domain has benefitted tremendously from [large pre-trained models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), while this is not the case as far as we are aware for the time series domain. Transformer based models seem like the obvious choice in pursuing this avenue of research and we cannot wait to see what researchers and practitioners come up with!\n"
