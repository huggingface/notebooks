In a multiple-choice task, multiple answers or continuations are provided for each input, and the model must guess which is most plausible.  The dataset used here is [SWAG](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1009/) but you can adapt the pre-processing to any other multiple choice dataset you like, or your own data. SWAG is a dataset about commonsense reasoning, where each example describes a situation and proposes four continuations that could follow it. \n",
