This isn't a problem for us in this notebook, because all of our examples are exactly the same length. Be careful with it when that isn't true, though - if you have a variable sequence length in your batches, then you might spend more time compiling your model than actually training, especially for small datasets!\n",

We could do it as a pre-processing step (like the tokenization) but then the tokens would always be masked the same way at each epoch. By doing this step inside the `data_collator`, we ensure this random masking is done in a new way each time we go over the data.\n",

You could also use `return_tensors='tf'` to get TensorFlow tensors, but our TF dataset pipeline actually uses a NumPy loader internally, which is wrapped at the end with a `tf.data.Dataset`. As a result, `np` is usually more reliable and performant when you're using it!"
