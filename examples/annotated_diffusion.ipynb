Attention is the building block of the famous Transformer architecture ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)), which has shown great success in various domains of AI, from NLP and vision to [protein folding](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology). Phil Wang employs 2 variants of attention: one is regular multi-head self-attention (as used in the Transformer), the other one is a [linear attention variant](https://github.com/lucidrains/linear-attention-transformer) ([Shen et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01243)), whose time- and memory requirements scale linear in the sequence length, as opposed to quadratic for regular attention.\n",

    "Generating new images from a diffusion model happens by reversing the diffusion process: we start from $T$, where we sample pure noise from a Gaussian distribution, and then use our neural network to gradually denoise it (using the conditional probability it has learned), until we end up at time step $t = 0$. As shown above, we can derive a slighly less denoised image $\\mathbf{x}_{t-1 }$ by plugging in the reparametrization of the mean, using our noise predictor. Remember that the variance is known ahead of time.\n",

    "- Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis ([Dhariwal et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233)): show that diffusion models can achieve image sample quality superior to the current state-of-the-art generative models by improving the U-Net architecture, as well as introducing classifier guidance\n",
    "- Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance ([Ho et al., 2021](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qw8AKxfYbI)): shows that you don't need a classifier for guiding a diffusion model by jointly training a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model with a single neural network\n",
    "- Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents (DALL-E 2) ([Ramesh et al., 2022](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-2.pdf)): use a prior to turn a text caption into a CLIP image embedding, after which a diffusion model decodes it into an image\n",
    "- Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding (ImageGen) ([Saharia et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487)): shows that combining a large pre-trained language model (e.g. T5) with cascaded diffusion works well for text-to-image synthesis\n",
