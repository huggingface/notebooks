@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united 6533 ORD to DCA
"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
@united I will not be flying you again
"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."
"@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!"
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
"@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement."
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
"@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat."
@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
@united thx for update
@united thank you !
@united dm these nuts
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
"@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy."
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@united Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@united Thank you.
@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
"@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey"
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
@united please be good to me this weekend!
"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
@united yall should probably work on that.
"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united DM does not work what do I do?
@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@united how about 3659 YUL-ORD?
"@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx"
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@united Done and done
"@united thanks, just sent :)"
"@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?"
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
"@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round"
"@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?"
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united thnx for the info
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united Okay thank you
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
"@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL"
@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@united yes I do.
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
@united Deep Vein thrombosis
"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
@united DM sent
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united But thanks for asking
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
"@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly."
@united you too!
@united is my favorite airline.
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
@united why would they make me share a room?
"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
"@united i understand, thanks"
"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"

@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!

"@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?"
@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
@united I hope so too
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
@united where is my flight voucher?
"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY

@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)

@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
"@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes"
"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control‚Äîthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
@united thank you.
Decisions Decisions @MandarinJourney @united:  We'd love for you to try our service. We offer status match too. http://t.co/xbQqqbRgVF ^KP‚Äù

"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site‚Äîit's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
‚Äú@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP‚Äù what's the point of membership?
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united Dmed you. Thank you
@united thanks we'll be in touch!
@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
"@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?"
@united like continental's chicken feat fairs
@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
Yes!! Thanks so much!!! üíú‚Äú@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY‚Äù
"@united captain ""on behalf of the front office, welcome on board."".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain"

"@united to be clear on my luggage comment, I am referencing the photo attached. Flight 6232 to JAC http://t.co/PnBajfkmHG"
@united These are great fares!!!!!
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@United so what‚Äôs the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ‚úàÔ∏è
@united So you are inadequate by accident?
@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
"@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now"
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
@united Thank you!
@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
"@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home"
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on"
@united I did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
"@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.

@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
@united I think DM would be better
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
@united done
"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
@united thank you
@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@united he has no priority and Iove it
@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù
@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@united Ok thank again for your help!
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
"@united This must be a drone ‚Äú@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"

"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better

"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
@united ok thx!
@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
@united go to hell
"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
@united Definitely will!
@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.

"@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?"

@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united that's not even an apology
@united that's cool - now what?
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"
"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
"@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981"
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
"@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?"
"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
"@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"
@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
"@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.."
@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
"@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"
@united it won't help...been there done that.
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@united would love help getting there today. In #EWR now. Will take any airline and connections. Thx
@united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
@united 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap
@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@united thank you!
@united Thanks for the update.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
"@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?"
"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@united please see dm!!
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
@united still no response??
@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@united Thanks!
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
"@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!"
@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
"@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way"
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@united at the gate! IAD to RDU
"@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule..."

@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
"@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help"
"@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR."
@united love the new 1st class breakfast!
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
"@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!"
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@united Left item n the seatback on UA1260. Is there any way to call DCA to ask if they have the item? Already submitted lost &amp; found report
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@united I DM'd child's birthdate and full name.
@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
"@united I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.
J"
"@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place."
@united it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response
@united Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much.
"@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!"
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@united flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!!
@united two years old.  Birthdate 11/13/2012
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@united I already did.
"@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here."
"@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck."
"@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR"
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@united what would it cost
@united I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService

"@united good morning, any first class upgrades available for ua1619 Feb 25  rsw to ewr? I need 4 seats please"
@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
"@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again."
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
"@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?"
".@united You may ""dislike delays"" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time."

"@united I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit"
@united please help http://t.co/t5mRj5Yw6I
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united hilarious
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
"@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm"
"@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee"
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
"@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!"
@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well
@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight
@united Was able to send the DM. All good now.

@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@united Thanks. Got it straightend out last night.
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
"@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback"
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
"@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?"
"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."

"@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH"
@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@united literally sucks
@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
"@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues"
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?

@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?

@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!

"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)

@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united I wanna be grand staff
"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"

"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@united i need help but in spanish
"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
@united UA1469. Just landed.
@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
@united flight 435
"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
@united thank you!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
@united your seats are god awful.
@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
@united i sure will
@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home üôåüôå
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
@united I need help with a missing bag.
@united I was. But I have given up.
"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."
@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united thank you for following up!
@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
@United can you help me get from IAH to SFO earlier tonight?
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
@united no thanks
@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
"@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!"
@united false.
"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."
"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."
".@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"

@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure

@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
"@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k"
@united AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits.
@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
@united +the plane.
"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
"@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"
@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
"@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?"
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@united ouch not fair
@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
@united I'll be calling tomorrow
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
"@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...‚úàÔ∏è"
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
"@united Okay, just requested to follow."
"@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated"
@united make sure you take care of @LSUsoftball team &amp; @LSUQuinlanDuhon team. We are 16-0!!!!
"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
"@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
"@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst"
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
"@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????"
"@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !"
@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
"@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
"@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc"
"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
"@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol"
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can‚Äôt fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
@united in fact he received my boarding pass
@united @Lmuschel he is traveling with me on a sep reservation number F3KxB8
‚Äú@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML‚Äù:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
"@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?"
@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
"@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff"
"@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good."
@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service üëé"
@united you guys are gay
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
"@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!"
"@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered"
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@united no thank you
"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
