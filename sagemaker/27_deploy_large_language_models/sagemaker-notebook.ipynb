    "# How to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) to Amazon SageMaker using new Hugging Face LLM DLC\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example on how to deploy the open-source LLMs, like [BLOOM](bigscience/bloom) to Amazon SageMaker for inference using the new Hugging Face LLM Inference Container. We will deploy [RedPajama 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-7B-v0.1) an open-source Chat LLM trained by Together on the Open Assistant dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example covers:\n",
    "1. Setup development environment\n",
    "2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC\n",
    "3. Deploy RedPajama 7B to Amazon SageMaker\n",

    "## What is Hugging Face LLM Inference DLC?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugging Face LLM DLC is a new purpose-built Inference Container to easily deploy LLMs in a secure and managed environment. The DLC is powered by [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference), an open-source, purpose-built solution for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs). TGI enables high-performance text generation using Tensor Parallelism and dynamic batching for the most popular open-source LLMs, including StarCoder, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, Llama, and T5. \n",
    "Text Generation Inference is already used by customers such as IBM, Grammarly, and the Open-Assistant initiative implements optimization for all supported model architectures, including:\n",
    "* Tensor Parallelism and custom cuda kernels\n",
    "* Optimized transformers code for inference using [flash-attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) on the most popular architectures\n",
    "* Quantization with [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)\n",
    "* [Continuous batching of incoming requests](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/tree/main/router) for increased total throughput\n",
    "* Accelerated weight loading (start-up time) with [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors)\n",
    "* Logits warpers (temperature scaling, topk, repetition penalty ...)\n",
    "* Watermarking with [A Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226)\n",
    "* Stop sequences, Log probabilities\n",
    "* Token streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Officially supported model architectures are currently: \n",
    "* [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) / [BLOOMZ](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz)\n",
    "* [MT0-XXL](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/mt0-xxl)\n",
    "* [Galactica](https://huggingface.co/facebook/galactica-120b)\n",
    "* [SantaCoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/santacoder)\n",
    "* [GPT-Neox 20B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) (joi, pythia, lotus, rosey, chip, RedPajama)\n",
    "* [FLAN-T5-XXL](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) (T5-11B)\n",
    "* [Llama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) (vicuna, alpaca, koala)\n",
    "* [Starcoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder) / [SantaCoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/santacoder)\n",

    "With the new Hugging Face LLM Inference DLCs on Amazon SageMaker, AWS customers can benefit from the same technologies that power highly concurrent, low latency LLM experiences like [HuggingChat](https://hf.co/chat), [OpenAssistant](https://open-assistant.io/), and Inference API for LLM models on the Hugging Face Hub. \n",
