    "# How to deploy Embedding Models to Amazon SageMaker using new Hugging Face Embedding DLC\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example on how to deploy the open Embedding Models, like [Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l), [BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) or [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to Amazon SageMaker for inference using the new Hugging Face Embedding Inference Container. We will deploy the [Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m) one of the best open Embedding Models for retrieval and ranking on the [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). \n",

    "## What is Hugging Face Embedding DLC?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hugging Face Embedding DLC is a new purpose-built Inference Container to easily deploy Embedding Models in a secure and managed environment. The DLC is powered by [Text Embedding Inference (TEI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference) a blazing fast and memory efficient solution for deploying and serving Embedding Models. TEI enables high-performance extraction for the most popular models, including FlagEmbedding, Ember, GTE and E5. TEI implements many features such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No model graph compilation step\n",
    "* Small docker images and fast boot times\n",
    "* Token based dynamic batching\n",
    "* Optimized transformers code for inference using Flash Attention, Candle and cuBLASLt\n",
    "* Safetensors weight loading\n",
    "* Production ready (distributed tracing with Open Telemetry, Prometheus metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "TEI supports the following model architectures\n",
    "* BERT/CamemBERT, e.g. [BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) or [Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m)\n",
    "* RoBERTa, [sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1) \n",
    "* XLM-RoBERTa, e.g. [sentence-transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1)\n",

    "Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our `HuggingFaceModel` model class with a `image_uri` pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face Embedding Container in Amazon SageMaker, we can use the `get_huggingface_llm_image_uri` method provided by the `sagemaker` SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face Embedding Container. Important to note is that TEI has 2 different versions for cpu and gpu, so we create a helper function to retrieve the correct image uri based on the instance type. "
