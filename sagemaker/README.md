# Hugging Face Transformers Amazon SageMaker Examples

Example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build, train, and deploy [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) using [Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) and the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


## 🛠️ Setup


The quickest setup to run example notebooks includes:
- An [AWS account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-account.html)
- Proper [IAM User and Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/authentication-and-access-control.html) setup
- An [Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html)
- An [S3 bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-config-permissions.html)
