    "Video classification is the task of assigning a label or class to an entire video. Videos are expected to have only one class for each video. Video classification models take a video as input and return a prediction about which class the video belongs to. These models can be used to categorize what a video is all about. A real-world application of video classification is action / activity recognition, which is useful for fitness applications. It is also helpful for vision-impaired individuals, especially when they are commuting.\n",

    "Leverage [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) from  🤗 Transformers for training the model. To instantiate a `Trainer`, you need to define the training configuration and an evaluation metric. The most important is the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to configure the training. It requires an output folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model. It also helps sync all the information in the model repository on 🤗 Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the training arguments are self-explanatory, but one that is quite important here is `remove_unused_columns=False`. This one will drop any features not used by the model's call function. By default it's `True` because usually it's ideal to drop unused feature columns, making it easier to unpack inputs into the model's call function. But, in this case, you need the unused features ('video' in particular) in order to create `pixel_values` (which is a mandatory key our model expects in its inputs)."
