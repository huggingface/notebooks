Some image-text-to-text models take in multiple images, but this alone is inadequate for a model to accept videos.\n",

    "Moreover, video-text-to-text models are often trained with all vision modalities. Each example might have videos, multiple videos, images and multiple images. Some of these models can also take interleaved inputs. For example, you can refer to a specific video inside a string of text by adding a video token in text like \"What is happening in this video? `<video>`\".\n",
