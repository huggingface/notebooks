When enough gradients are accumulated we run the model's optimization step. This way we can easily increase the overall batch size to numbers that would never fit into the GPU's memory.

This is generally achieved by utilizing the GPU as much as possible and thus filling GPU memory to its limit. For example, as mentioned earlier, we only employ gradient accumulation when we want to use a batch size beyond the size of the GPU memory. If the desired batch size fits into memory then there is no reason to apply gradient accumulation which will only slow down training. \n",

Although they are more expensive they are usually more cost effective than cheaper GPUs due to their larger memory and faster architecture.

The idea is very similar to gradient accumulation with the distinction that instead of running the forward and backward passes during the accumulation in sequence on a single machine they are performed in parallel on multiple machines. So each GPU gets a small batch, runs the forward and backward passes and then the gradients from all machines are aggregated and the model is optimized. You can combine this with all the methods we described before. For example, if you have 4 GPUs and use `per_device_train_batch_size=12` and `gradient_accumulation_steps=3` you will have an effective batch size of `4*12*3=144`. \n",

The cache is maintained only within a particular outermost autocast context. When you exit the autocast context the cache is dropped. For recommended usage, in which autocast wraps the forward pass, and then you exit the context before calling backward(), this means the cache only lasts the duration of the forward pass each iteration, and will be rebuilt next iteration.
