# ðŸ¤— Transformers doc notebooks

These notebooks are automatically generated from the [ðŸ¤— Transformers documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
so you should not make any direct modification here. If there is a typo to fix or a sentence to add, open a pull
request in the [ðŸ¤— Transformers repo](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and fix the corresponding file in
the `docs/source/` folder.

If there is something that seems weirdly converted from the original doc file, open an issue in this repo and we will
try to fix the conversion script.

**Note:** If you are looking for a particular notebook and can't find it, it may have moved inside the `en` subfolder.

**Warning:** The Tensorflow backend for transformers has been [deprecated](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/38758). The notebooks under the `tensorflow` folder will not be actively maintained and may not give the correct output.
