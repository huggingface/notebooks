    "\n",
    "Why is code better? Well, because we crafted our code languages specifically to be great at expressing actions performed by a computer. If JSON snippets was a better way, this package would have been written in JSON snippets and the devil would be laughing at us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is just a better way to express actions on a computer. It has better:\n",
    "- **Composability:** could you nest JSON actions within each other, or define a set of JSON actions to re-use later, the same way you could just define a python function?\n",
    "- **Object management:** how do you store the output of an action like `generate_image` in JSON?\n",
    "- **Generality:** code is built to express simply anything you can do have a computer do.\n",

For instance if you've allowed an innocuous package like `Pillow` to process images, the LLM could generate thousands of saves of images to bloat your hard drive.\n",
