    "Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is “using an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base”. It has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "But vanilla RAG has limitations, most importantly these two:\n",
    "- It performs only one retrieval step: if the results are bad, the generation in turn will be bad.\n",
    "- Semantic similarity is computed with the user query as a reference, which might be suboptimal: for instance, the user query will often be a question and the document containing the true answer will be in affirmative voice, so its similarity score will be downgraded compared to other source documents in the interrogative form, leading to a risk of missing the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can alleviate these problems by making a RAG agent: very simply, an agent armed with a retriever tool!\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent will: ✅ Formulate the query itself and ✅ Critique to re-retrieve if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it should naively recover some advanced RAG techniques!\n",
    "- Instead of directly using the user query as the reference in semantic search, the agent formulates itself a reference sentence that can be closer to the targeted documents, as in [HyDE](https://huggingface.co/papers/2212.10496).\n",
