    "[Multiple](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030) [research](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.01747) [papers](https://huggingface.co/papers/2401.00812) have shown that having the LLM write its actions (the tool calls) in code is much better than the current standard format for tool calling, which is across the industry different shades of \"writing actions as a JSON of tools names and arguments to use\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is code better? Well, because we crafted our code languages specifically to be great at expressing actions performed by a computer. If JSON snippets were a better way, this package would have been written in JSON snippets and the devil would be laughing at us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is just a better way to express actions on a computer. It has better:\n",
    "- **Composability:** could you nest JSON actions within each other, or define a set of JSON actions to re-use later, the same way you could just define a python function?\n",
    "- **Object management:** how do you store the output of an action like `generate_image` in JSON?\n",
    "- **Generality:** code is built to express simply anything you can have a computer do.\n",
    "- **Representation in LLM training corpus:** why not leverage this benediction of the sky that plenty of quality actions have already been included in LLM training corpus?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is illustrated on the figure below, taken from [Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030).\n",

    "By default, the `CodeAgent` runs LLM-generated code in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is inherently risky, LLM-generated code could be harmful to your environment.\n",
    "One could argue that on the [spectrum of agency](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/tutorials/../conceptual_guides/intro_agents), code agents give much higher agency to the LLM on your system than other less agentic setups: this goes hand-in-hand with higher risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need to be mindful of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a first layer of security, code execution in `smolagents` is not performed by the vanilla Python interpreter.\n",
    "We have re-built a more secure `LocalPythonInterpreter` from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, this interpreter works by loading the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from your Code and executes it operation by operation, making sure to always follow certain rules:\n",
    "- By default, imports are disallowed unless they have been explicitly added to an authorization list by the user.\n",
    "   - Even so, because some innocuous packages like `re` can give access to potentially harmful packages as in `re.subprocess`, subpackages that match a list of dangerous patterns are not imported.\n",
    " - The total count of elementary operations processed is capped to prevent infinite loops and resource bloating.\n",
    " - Any operation that has not been explicitly defined in our custom interpreter will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, this interpreter is safer. We have used it on a diversity of use cases, without ever observing any damage to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this solution is certainly not watertight, as no local python sandbox can really be: one could imagine occasions where LLMs fine-tuned for malignant actions could still hurt your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you have allowed an innocuous package like `Pillow` to process images, the LLM could generate thousands of image saves to bloat your hard drive.\n",
    "Other examples of attacks can be found [here](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/n/python_sandbox_escape).\n",
    "\n",
    "Running these targeted malicious code snippet require a supply chain attack, meaning the LLM you use has been intoxicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood of this happening is low when using well-known LLMs from trusted inference providers, but it is still non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!WARNING]\n",
    "> The only way to run LLM-generated code securely is to isolate the execution from your local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you want to exercise caution, you should use a remote execution sandbox.\n",
    "\n",
