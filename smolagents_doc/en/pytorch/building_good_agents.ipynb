    "Let's revisit the example from the [intro to agents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/tutorials/../conceptual_guides/intro_agents): a bot that answers user queries for a surf trip company.\n",
    "Instead of letting the agent do 2 different calls for \"travel distance API\" and \"weather API\" each time they are asked about a new surf spot, you could just make one unified tool \"return_spot_information\", a function that calls both APIs at once and returns their concatenated outputs to the user.\n",

    "To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\n",

    "2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n",

    "4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n",
    "5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n",
    "6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n",
    "7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n",
    "8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\n",
    "9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n",
    "10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n",
