    "`smolagents` comes with two agent classes: [CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) and [ToolCallingAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent), which represent two different paradigms for how agents interact with tools.\n",
    "The key difference lies in how actions are specified and executed: code generation vs structured tool calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) generates tool calls as Python code snippets.\n",
    "  - The code is executed either locally (potentially unsecure) or in a secure sandbox.\n",
    "  - Tools are exposed as Python functions (via bindings).\n",
    "  - Example of tool call:\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    result = search_docs(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Strengths:\n",
    "    - Highly expressive: Allows for complex logic and control flow and can combine tools, loop, transform, reason.\n",
    "    - Flexible: No need to predefine every possible action, can dynamically generate new actions/tools.\n",
    "    - Emergent reasoning: Ideal for multi-step problems or dynamic logic.\n",
    "  - Limitations\n",
    "    - Risk of errors: Must handle syntax errors, exceptions.\n",
    "    - Less predictable: More prone to unexpected or unsafe outputs.\n",
    "    - Requires secure execution environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ToolCallingAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent) writes tool calls as structured JSON.\n",
    "  - This is the common format used in many frameworks (OpenAI API), allowing for structured tool interactions without code execution.\n",
    "  - Tools are defined with a JSON schema: name, description, parameter types, etc.\n",
    "  - Example of tool call:\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"tool_call\": {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"search_docs\",\n",
    "        \"arguments\": {\n",
    "          \"query\": \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Strengths:\n",
    "    - Reliable: Less prone to hallucination, outputs are structured and validated.\n",
    "    - Safe: Arguments are strictly validated, no risk of arbitrary code running.\n",
    "    - Interoperable: Easy to map to external APIs or services.\n",
    "  - Limitations:\n",
    "    - Low expressivity: Can't easily combine or transform results dynamically, or perform complex logic or control flow.\n",
    "    - Inflexible: Must define all possible actions in advance, limited to predefined tools.\n",
    "    - No code synthesis: Limited to tool capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use which agent type:\n",
    "- Use [CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) when:\n",
    "  - You need reasoning, chaining, or dynamic composition.\n",
    "  - Tools are functions that can be combined (e.g., parsing + math + querying).\n",
    "  - Your agent is a problem solver or programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use [ToolCallingAgent](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent) when:\n",
    "  - You have simple, atomic tools (e.g., call an API, fetch a document).\n",
    "  - You want high reliability and clear validation.\n",
    "  - Your agent is like a dispatcher or controller."
